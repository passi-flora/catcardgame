# Turn based cat fight

Preliminary:  
The dice are rolled with a "plusminus W6". A normal six-sided die, where even numbers are added to your own value, odd numbers are subtracted. See "Special rules" for more information.

The configuration of the cats can be found at the bottom of this manual.

## BEGINNING
First roll the dice, the cat that rolls the higher number starts.

## SNEAK
Cat A starts by sneaking up on cat B. Both roll the dice and change their value SNEAK with the rolled number of points and compare both values. If Cat A's SNEAK value is higher than Cat B's, Cat A manages to sneak up and can immediately perform an attack. If cat B's value is higher, she notices the sneak up and it's her turn to attack.

## ATTACK 
Suppose cat A attacks cat B. Cat A rolls the dice and thus changes her value "ATTACK". Cat B now has two options: DEFEND or JUMP. A DEFEND is an attempt to block the attack, a JUMP is an attempt by Cat B to avoid the blow by jumping. You have to decide between DEFEND or JUMP, and then you can roll the dice.

## DEFEND
If Cat B has decided on a DEFEND, she rolls the dice and thus changes her DEFEND value. The value is compared with cat A's ATTACK. If its value is higher or equal to the (changed) ATTACK value of Cat A, it parries the blow. However, cat A is then again with an attack.

## JUMP
If Cat B decides to JUMP, Cat B and Cat A roll on their JUMP value and change it by the die. If Cat B's value is higher than Cat A's, she can escape by making a skillful jump and escapes the attack. It is then her turn to attack. If the value of cat A is higher than that of cat B, cat B jumps away, but cat A follows and it is cat A's turn to attack again.

## HEALTH
Each cat has 3 health points. If a DEFEND or a JUMP fails, a hit is generated. The cat loses one life point. At 0 life points, the cat is knocked out and becomes (temporarily) unconscious; the game is then over.

## SPECIAL RULES
## CRITICAL HIT
Scene: ATTACK.  If you roll a 6, you can roll again. If you roll a 6 again on the confirmation roll, this is a critical hit that cannot be parried by the other cat. One life point is immediately subtracted from the other cat. 

## CRITICAL GOOF
Scene: ATTACK.  If you roll a 5, you roll again. If you roll a 5 again on the confirmation roll, it is a critical goof. You take a swing with your paw, but miss the other cat and lose your balance up on the wall. It is the other cat's turn to attack.

## LUCKY FATE
Scene: DEFEND. If you roll a 6, you can roll again. If you roll a 6 again in the confirmation roll, it is a LUCKY FATE, you gain the upper hand and parry the other cat's blow so skillfully that it is now your turn to attack.

## UNLUCKY CAT
Scene: DEFEND. If you roll a 5, you roll again. If you roll a 5 again in the confirmation roll, you are so clumsy that you fall off the wall during the attack, losing 2 life points at the same time.

**By the way:** If a value cannot be confirmed, it simply counts the single number. So 6 & 1 = 6; 6 & 4 = 6; etc.; the same applies to an unconfirmed 5.

## FLEEING
Suppose: Cat A wants to escape to save her life points. This is only possible if she has the upper hand at the moment, that is, if she is allowed to attack. Now Cat A and Cat B roll the dice for QUICKNESS. If Cat A's value is higher than Cat B's, Cat A escapes and is safe. If Cat B's value is higher, Cat B catches up with Cat A and Cat B has the upper hand, so can start attacking. Again, if Cat A rolls a 6 and confirms it on the second roll, it escapes immediately. If cat B rolls 6 twice in a row, cat A is immediately caught up. If Cat A rolls a 5 twice in a row, she stumbles, loses a life point, and Cat B catches up with her immediately. If Cat B rolls a 5 twice in a row, she injures herself chasing Cat A and loses one life point.

## REGENERATION
If you play with several cats, an escape can be quite worthwhile. The cat that successfully escaped is put aside. For every 5 minutes it recovers 1 life point.

## OTHER RULES
Do you want to change or add to the rules? Just do it the way you like it ^.^ The main thing is to have fun playing the game and keep it fair.

## EXAMPLE CAT
Make sure that when you distribute the values, the total sum is 70.
